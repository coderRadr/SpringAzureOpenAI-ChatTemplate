## Features

- Spring Boot: A Java-based framework to build the application.
- Gradle: Used as the build tool.
- Azure OpenAI: Integrates with Azure OpenAI service to interact with ChatGPT.
- REST API: Provides a simple REST endpoint to interact with the AI model.

## Prerequisites

- Java 21 or later
- Gradle 8.5x or higher
- An Azure subscription with access to the OpenAI service
- Azure OpenAI API key

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/coderRadr/SpringAzureOpenAI-ChatTemplate.git
    cd SpringAzureOpenAI-ChatTemplate
    ```

2. **Set up Azure OpenAI:**
You need to set up your Azure OpenAI credentials. Create a file named application.yml in the src/main/resources directory with the following content
    ```
    spring:
     ai:
       azure:
         openai:
           api-key: <azure-openAI-api-key>
           endpoint: <azure-openAI-endpoint>
           chat:
             options:
               deployment-name: <azure-openAI-deployment-name>
               model-name: <azure-openAI-model-name>
    ```
   
   ```
   Replace the properties with Azure Open AI credentials, Refer: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
To build the project, run the following command:
   ```
   ./gradlew build
   ```
4. **Run the application:**
To start the application, run:
   ```
   ./gradlew bootRun
